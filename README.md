# Stale closure and React.memo (unoptimized branch)

Whenever we click on the `Update count` button, the state of `count` gets updated, leading to the re-rendering of the `App` component. Consequently, `heavyComponentHandler` and `updateCount` are re-created with new memory references. As a result of the parent component getting re-rendered and the prop value being updated, `HeavyComponent` will also be re-rendered.
